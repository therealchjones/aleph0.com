				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>
					Once upon a time, I began using
					<a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> as a part of the
					<a href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing/"
						>Aleph 0 Computing Project</a
					>
					in lieu of <a href="http://www.linux.org">GNU/Linux</a>. I was able to
					learn enough to use it as my primary operating system. Below is a bit
					about why I made the switch, as well as a small collection of tips to
					help you along in a similar&mdash;or vastly different&mdash;setup.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="history">
				<h2>History</h2>

				<p>
					I discovered OpenBSD during the summer of 2004, and soon thereafter
					used it to replace the continuing development of
					<a href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing/linux/">Infinit GNU/Linux</a
					>, which had gone more slowly and unsuccessfully than I had hoped. I
					began developing my own Linux distribution because I couldn&#39;t find
					an existing one which satisfied me, and to teach me about the myriad
					ways a modern Unix-like system is put together. The difficulty, of
					course, is that the answer to &ldquo;How is a modern Unix-like system
					put together?&rdquo; seems to be &ldquo;Not very well.&rdquo; A modern
					<em>UNIX</em> system, on the other hand, seems to be working great for
					me. There&#39;s little question of following UNIX tradition and
					standards, the documentation is fantastic, and (if possible), OpenBSD
					is even
					<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq1.html#ReallyFree"
						>more free</a
					>
					than GNU/Linux.
				</p>

				<p>
					(A quick note is in order here. From a legal standpoint (and
					<em>only</em> a legal standpoint), none of the BSDs can actually call
					themselves UNIX, and rely instead on the term &ldquo;UNIX-like&rdquo;.
					This makes some sense, but is also fairly misleading. Linux, Minix,
					and some similar systems are &ldquo;UNIX-like&rdquo;; they&#39;re
					clones built from scratch, influenced by various systems. The BSDs, on
					the other hand, are evolutionary, and may contain absolutely none of
					the original UNIX code, but were stepwise removed, not reinvented.)
				</p>

				<p>
					So why OpenBSD instead of
					<a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a> or
					<a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>? They have slightly
					different aims. My <em>impressions</em> (and I have no experience
					whether they&#39;re accurate or not) include NetBSD concentrating more
					on portability (something that is important to me, but not really of
					primary concern at the moment), FreeBSD being cutting-edge (which is
					nice, but not at the cost of stability or security), and OpenBSD being
					an outstanding, stable, secure, and <em>standard</em> UNIX
					system&mdash;something I&#39;ve been seeking for months or years.

				<h2>Dual-booting OpenBSD and Windows XP</h2>

				<p>
					I&#39;ve included information from the OpenBSD FAQ entry on
					dual-booting an OpenBSD machine, as well as added a few tips on
					&ldquo;little things&rdquo; like making the clock work properly in
					both operating systems, in a brief
					<a href="dualboot/">guide to dual-booting OpenBSD and Windows XP</a>.
					I no longer use Windows XP and OpenBSD on the same machine, but plan
					to leave the tips archived here indefinitely.

				<h2>Running OpenBSD on a Dell Inspiron 1000</h2>

				<p>
					For a couple of years, I ran OpenBSD on a Dell Inspiron 1000 laptop.
					It ran reasonably well, but there were plenty of issues I was able to
					work around, and others appear to have found those tips helpful from
					time to time. Though I no longer run OpenBSD on that particular
					machine, I have archived the info on
					<a href="inspiron-1000/">running OpenBSD on the Inspiron 1000</a>.
