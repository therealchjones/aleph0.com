<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>One of many machines making up the original <a
href="/computing/">Aleph 0 Computing Project</a>, &ldquo;dave&rdquo; was a <a
href="http://www.dell.com/">Dell</a> Inspiron 1000 (BIOS revision A08)
laptop with a 2.2 GHz Intel Celeron processor running
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>.  It used OpenBSD up through
version 3.9, and was used for testing and preparing customized builds of
OpenBSD more than anything else.  OpenBSD-interpreted specifications may be found in <a
href="dmesg-OpenBSD-3.9">dave&#39;s dmesg</a>;  another document
that may be useful to you is <a
href="xorg.conf-OpenBSD-3.9">dave&#39;s xorg.conf</a>.  Further specifications
and documentation are below.</p>

<p>This page is designed to include descriptions of (and, where available,
workarounds for) unexpected behavior of the machine in general and of
OpenBSD on the machine in particular.  All of the below information at
least tangentially applies to running OpenBSD on the Inspiron 1000, but
may apply to other operating systems as well.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>For this document, &ldquo;problems&rdquo; are things that don&#39;t work
at all, or require a significant amount of effort to put into a barely-usable
state.  Some issues may be located instead under the below <a
href="#usage">Usage</a> section, especially tiny oddities or issues with
relatively simple workarounds.</p>

<div id="apm-problem">

<h3>APM</h3>

<p>The major problem I have with dave (running OpenBSD 3.9) is kind of
a big one:  the APM (power management) does not work.  This means dave&#39;s
battery life is short, and some simple configuration has to be done to keep
the kernel from panicking on boot.  If you&#39;re seeing an error like this:</p>

<pre>
apm0 at bios0: Power Management spec V1.2
uvm_fault(0xd0554ca0, 0x4000, 0, 1) -&gt; e
fatal page fault in supervisor mode
trap type 6 code 0 eip d02307ad cs 8 eflags 10046 cr2 469a cpl 0
panic: trap type 6, code=0, pc=d02307ad

The operating system has halted.
Please press any key to reboot.
</pre>

<p>when trying to boot, then you may have this problem as well.  (The <a
href="dmesg-OpenBSD-3.9-install">full dmesg of the panic</a> doesn&#39;t shed
much more light.)  To even install OpenBSD, the following steps are
necessary:</p>

<ol>
<li>At the <code>boot&gt;</code> prompt, enter <code>boot&nbsp;-c</code>.</li>
<li>At the resulting <code>UKC&gt;</code> prompt, enter
<code>disable&nbsp;apm0</code>; at the next, enter <code>quit</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This disables kernel support for APM and keeps it from panicking.  After the
installation, you&#39;ll need to do the same thing for the first boot.
Finally, you can do the following (similar) steps to prevent a repeat of the
above on every boot:</p>

<pre>
$ /usr/sbin/config -e -o ./bsd-noapm /bsd
OpenBSD 3.7 (GENERIC) &hellip;
Enter 'help' for information
ukc&gt; disable apm0
252 apm0 disabled
ukc&gt; quit
Saving modified kernel.
$ su
Password:
# cp /bsd /bsd.orig
# mv ./bsd-noapm /bsd
</pre>

<p>(Note, however, that you&#39;ll have to repeat the above whenever you
build a new kernel.)</p>

<h4>Status</h4>

<p>This problem is currently filed as <a
href="http://cvs.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-wrapper?full=yes&amp;numbers=5084">OpenBSD
bug i386/5084: APM causes kernel panic on Dell Inspiron 1000</a>;  it was
submitted on 22 April 2006 and is open as of this writing.</p>

<h3>Fn Keys: Volume and Mute</h3>

<p>dave includes a &ldquo;Fn&rdquo; button near the bottom left of the
keyboard, useful for several additional hotkey functions (see <a
href="#usage">Usage</a>, below).  I haven&#39;t yet found a way to get
the volume or mute buttons to work under OpenBSD.  That doesn&#39;t mean
there isn&#39;t one, but I haven&#39;t put more than about 20 minutes into
searching.</p>

<h3>Modem</h3>

<p>The modem built into dave is a SiS 7013 software modem or
&ldquo;winmodem&rdquo;, which does not work under OpenBSD.</p>

<h3>CD Audio</h3>

<p>This machine doesn&#39;t seem to play audio CDs directly from disc, even
when the audio is set up correctly.  It&#39;s probably due to a lack of a
digital audio connection from the drive to the sound chipset.  Mounting the
disc and playing the files works fine, as does copying the music
to MP3 or Ogg.</p>

</div><!-- problems -->

<div id="usage">

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>There are some interesting &ldquo;quirks&rdquo; that don&#39;t behave
exactly as I&#39;d expect them to.  All of the points in this section hold
for OpenBSD, but have not been tested under any other operating system.
This section also contains items on how to make the machine act more
like you&#39;d expect;  many involve editing OpenBSD configuration
files.</p>

<h3>Screen Stretch</h3>

<p>One of dave&#39;s more surprising features is the fact that, by default,
any resolution is displayed full screen.  This is in a stark contrast to my
other Dell laptop, which displays the console fairly small in the middle of
the screen with large borders&mdash;as I understand is common for LCD
displays.  This feature may actually be toggled with Fn-F5;  it&#39;s
documented in the Owner&#39;s Manual, but
there&#39;s no informative icon on the F5 key to remind you of this fact.</p>

<h3>System Beep</h3>

<p>dave has a &ldquo;System Beep&rdquo; toggle key;  hold down
&ldquo;Fn&rdquo; and hit the F6 key (the one with the speaker with a B
beside it).  It has no funtion in the default OpenBSD setup, since the
system speaker is off in the software.  To turn it on:</p>
<pre>
mixerctl inputs.phone.mute=off
</pre>
<p>(See <code>mixerctl(1)</code> for more on this and
<code>mixerctl.conf(5)</code> for how to set it on system startup.)</p>
<p>To check to see if it&#39;s working, do Fn-F6 a couple of times;  a
higher-pitched tone means the system beep is enabled;  no tone means it&#39;s
disabled or your mixer still isn&#39;t set up right.</p>

<h3>VGA Out</h3>

<p>It works with a very small bit of configuration, though not quite the
way Dell or the X.org documentation suggests it will.  By adding (or
uncommenting) the line <code>Option "ForceCRT1"</code> in the xorg.conf file
(as in <a href="xorg.conf-OpenBSD-3.9">dave&#39;s xorg.conf</a>),
you can enable the VGA out&mdash;but there&#39;s no way to turn it off.
The Fn-F3 hotkey only seems to turn on or off the laptop&#39;s LCD, not
cycle through all three possible states.  X.org docs suggest that the
display should be automatically enabled if connected when starting X, but,
while my external monitor does seem to get some signal in that case, no
picture is displayed.</p>

<h3>Numeric keypad</h3>

<p>Dell&#39;s user guide claims that the Num Lock key in the upper right-hand
corner of the keyboard allows a few keys on the right-hand side to behave
just like the numeric keypad on a standard 101-key.  In reality, it&#39;s a
bit unusual:  to use the &ldquo;numeric keypad&rdquo;, start by pressing the
Num Lock key.  (You&#39;ll note the indicator light illuminates.)  To then,
say, make hitting &ldquo;i&rdquo; enter &ldquo;5&rdquo;, <em>also hold
down the &ldquo;Fn&rdquo; key when hitting &ldquo;i&rdquo;</em>.  With
Num Lock on, and the Fn key depressed, the entered stroke will be that on
the bottom right corner of the key pressed.  Instead of using the Num Lock
key, if you like, holding down Shift and Fn at the same time will have the
same effect.</p>

<p>To enter the stroke on the bottom center of the key (such as the arrows,
Home, Insert, and so forth, depress the Fn key, <em>but make sure Num Lock
(and Shift) is off</em> when hitting the key.</p>

<p>Finally, note that the PgUp, PgDn, Del, and Ins keys don&#39;t work as
you might expect them to at the command prompt, at least in <code>sh</code>
without special configuration.  That&#39;s an issue with the OpenBSD setup,
though&mdash;the non-keypad versions don&#39;t do it either, and they all
work fine in <code>vi</code>.</p>

<h3>Memory</h3>

<p>The <a href="#docs">official documentation</a> is a little sketchy on
memory;  some experimentation shows that what information is documented may
not be entirely accurate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crucial.com/">Crucial</a>&#39;s memory selector suggests
adding a 256MB PC2700 module to this system.  Since that&#39;s the most
supported in the single removable memory slot, it&#39;s probably not a bad
idea.  Trouble is, it seems the integrated memory is only PC2100, hence the
speed of both is set to 266MHz as opposed to the higher 333MHz in the PC2700.
I&#39;d therefore consider the fastest supported memory to be PC2100
(266MHz).</p>

<p>Along the same lines, note that it&#39;s hard-coded into the BIOS to
use 32MB of this memory for the video card when the total system memory is
256MB;  this automatically jumps to 64MB when the system memory is more.</p>

<p>Finally, the system officially supports adding up to another 256 MB, in
addition to the 256MB built-in.  This allows a maximum system memory of only
512MB, about 450 after the built-in video memory is taken away.  Surprisingly,
however, it seems that more RAM works just fine.  On a lark, I placed a 512MB
SODIMM into the machine;  sure enough, it reports system memory of 768MB and
&ldquo;usable&rdquo; memory of 702MB, and everything seems to test fine in <a
href="http://www.memtest.org/">Memtest86+</a> 1.65.  Maybe one of these days
I&#39;ll try to find a 1GB SODIMM I can try out.</p>
