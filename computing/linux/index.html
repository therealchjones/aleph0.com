				For about nine months in 2003 and 2004, I worked on a project to create
				a free, simple, complete, portable, self-building, CD-bootable
				distribution of <a href="http://www.linux.org">GNU/Linux</a>. It
				progressed to being quite usable as a server or desktop, but lacked a
				graphical user interface and more advanced programs. I expected to learn
				a lot about how a modern Unix-like system is constructed, and how to
				build one from source; that goal was met. I also hoped to replace all
				the operating systems currently running on my computers with a
				distribution I made; progress was increasingly slow, tedious, and lacked
				passion for several weeks. I have now stopped development.
			</p>

			<p>
				As of 18 July 2004, The Infinit GNU/Linux project has come to an end. I
				have learned a great deal about Linux and its affiliated tools; that was
				the entire point of the project. The creation of a usable, standard,
				Unix-like operating system (even when all the heavy lifting has already
				been done) is an incredibly difficult task; the attempt, however, was
				still worthwhile.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have begun using <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> for the
				most critical tasks (server, laptop, etc.), and plan to use
				<a href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a> for Linux-dependent
				machines (should OpenBSD not satisfy the needs of, say, video editing or
				media center). I strongly encourage others who desire a free, simple,
				complete, portable, self-building, CD-bootable, Unix-like system to go
				whole hog and use UNIX, in the form of one of the BSDs.
				<a href="http://www.aleph0.com/computing/openbsd/">My OpenBSD page</a>
				describes a bit more about this process.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thanks to everyone who downloaded Infinit GNU/Linux; if you&#39;re still
				looking to do something similar yourself, I strongly encourage a look at
				<a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org">Linux From Scratch</a> and
				<a href="http://web.rsise.anu.edu.au/~okeefe/p2b/buildMin/buildMin.html"
					>How To Build a Minimal Linux System from Source Code</a
				>
				to get you started. In my opinion, simply following the directions
				won&#39;t teach you much, but reading plenty of documentation and
				performing lots of trial-and-error work will.
