<h1>Aleph&nbsp;0</h1>

<div id="intro">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.aleph0.com/">Aleph&nbsp;0</a> is the personal 
unincorporated organization whose sole proprietor and member is <a 
href="http://www.aleph0.com/~chjones/">Christian&nbsp;Jones</a>.  
That&#39;s right, it&#39;s really nothing more than a vanity domain that 
serves Mr.&nbsp;Jones&#39;s overdeveloped sense of ego, a place for him 
to organize his projects and to bring light to his ambitions.  Thank you 
for feeding his zeal.  Please keep your hands inside the vehicle at all 
times.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>Aleph&nbsp;0, at the moment, contains two categories of interest 
whose importance is unrivaled throughout all of cyberspace:  
information on the <a href="computing/">Aleph&nbsp;0 Computing 
Project</a> and the homepages of <a href="users/">Aleph&nbsp;0 
users</a>.  These are nearly overfilled with information vital to both 
personal and international interests;  please explore them as thoroughly
as possible before moving on with your life.</p>

<h2>Affiliates</h2>

<p>Aleph&nbsp;0 is affiliated with a small number of other sites that 
fall under the oppressive thumb of Mr.&nbsp;Jones.  <a
href="http://www.christianjones.md">ChristianJones.MD</a> is his
&ldquo;professional&rdquo; site, dedicated to his goals of 
treating patients, shaping health policy, and making the world a 
nominally better place.  <a href="http://www.norightsreserved.org">No 
Rights Reserved</a> is his vain attempt to convince others to truly free
their work by dedicating it to the public domain instead of encumbering 
it with copyrights.</p>
